# Mushroom Classification Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Mushroom Dataset to explore the impact of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on classification performance using Logistic Regression. The dataset consists entirely of categorical features, and the analysis aims to demonstrate how dimensionality reduction can affect model accuracy and interpretability.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess the Mushroom Dataset.
- Apply one-hot encoding to convert categorical features into a numerical format.
- Standardize the features to ensure equal contribution to PCA.
- Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality while retaining variance.
- Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model on both the original and PCA-transformed data.
- Compare model performance and analyze the effects of dimensionality reduction.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open `mushroom_report.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis.

## Conclusion
Dimensionality reduction using PCA can simplify models and reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy. This project provides insights into the effectiveness of PCA in handling high-dimensional categorical datasets."# DA5401_ASSIGNMENT2"
